# Arcadium Network Token (ATRC) - Dapp Interface

## Introduction
Arcadium Network Token is a "Deflationary Proof-of-Stake" TRC-20 Token deployed on the TRON Network. This repository contains a series of files which compose entirely an interface capable of interacting with ATRC's Smart Contract. This codebase has been written in clear HTML, CSS and Javascript, allowing easy building upon and expansion of its capabilities.

## Details
 - 1,000,000,000 Tokens Total Supply (1 Billion)
 - 1% burn on every transfer of tokens
 - 5% fee on Unstake of tokens, distributed as Dividends to remaining Stakers
 
 - Stake tokens to earn Dividends as ATRC - This uses the 'freeze()' function in the Smart Contract.
 - Unstake tokens and see them in your Tron Wallet straight away - this uses the 'unfreeze()' function.
 
## Purpose
This token and Dapp interface have been created and published to give Arcadium Network a token on a blockchain - something that has (up until commiting of this change) not been established. Consensus between early developers of Arcadium Network was to have a token which would be useable across multiple projects - using the TRC-20 standard, the groundwork for this has been established.

Arcadium Network will likely publish more new tokens and contracts in the future - This one however is it's core on TRON - the ATRC Token is Arcadium Network's blockchain representation.
